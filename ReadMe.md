# Simple MVC 📚

MVC  => Model View Controller

- Model: Data
- View: UI
- Controller: Logic

## Data Flow 🚨

1. User interacts with the View
1. View sends the user's action to the Controller
1. Controller updates the Model
1. Model notifies the Controller of the changes
1. View queries the controller and update itself

Depends on the POV (Point of View) the data flow in the MVC will differ. The above mentioned
data flow is for WPF or Desktop application in which the view acts a primary user action.
